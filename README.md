# Fire From The Booth.

This is my Portfolio Site. The title is a pun on my name, some slang and a popular radio/youtube show that showcases the talent on the rap/grime/Hip-Hop Scene.

I Designed it myself using figma : https://www.figma.com/file/zIBuCztelBzlQ9rHRsEil9/fire-from-the-booth?node-id=0%3A1

Then built it using React.

It is currently in its MVP form as I am searching for Junior Developer Role. Watch it get fancier as my skills do (if I remember it exists after I have a job)
